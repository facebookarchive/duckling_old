# Duckling

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/wit/duckling/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/wit/duckling)

Duckling is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:

    “the first Tuesday of October” => {:value "2014-10-07T00:00:00.000-07:00"
                                       :grain :day}


You can try it out at https://duckling.wit.ai

See our [blog post announcement](https://wit.ai/blog/2014/10/01/open-source-parser-duckling) for more context.

## Getting started

To use Duckling in your project, you just need two functions: `load!` to load the default configuration, and `parse` to parse a string.

```clojure
(ns myproject.core
  (:require [duckling.core :as p]))

(p/load!) ;; Load all languages

(p/parse :en$core ;; core configuration for English ; see also :fr$core, :es$core, :zh$core
         "wake me up the last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"
         [:time]) ;; We are interested in :time expressions only ; see also :duration, :temperature, etc.

;; => [{:label :time
;;        :start 15
;;        :end 49
;;        :value {:type "value", :value "2015-01-26T06:00:00.000-02:00", :grain :hour}
;;        :body "last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"}]
```
