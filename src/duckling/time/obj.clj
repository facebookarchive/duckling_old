; This ns constructs and operates time objects. It's a wall between Picsou and
; the actual implementation of time (here, clj-time).
;
; Intervally there are two kinds of time objects:
; 1) "Grains" defined by a :start instant and a :grain
; 2) True intervals defined by :start and :end instants. They also have a grain
;    because :end is exclusive, and we need a grain to know what to exclude
;
; Some fn like 'round', 'year' (and all the field getters) operate on the :start
; instant. If you use them, make sure it's what you want.
