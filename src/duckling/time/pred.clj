; First-order Predicates
;
; A predicate is a function that given an input time interval,
; returns two possibly infinite lazy seqs: 
; one of intervals ahead, one of intervals behind.
;
; Ahead contains the succession of intervals ending after the start of input
; So if input is 2014-6-18 and pred is (year 2014), the first item in ahead
; will be the year 2014.
;
; Behind contains intervals ending before the *start* of input [1]
; So with the same example, behind is empty.
;
; [1] As a consequence, the end of input doesn't matter. This is leveraged by
; the fact that time functions called on input (round, year, etc.) all actually
; use the start field, not the end.

; By default year converts two-digits to a year between 1950 and 2050
; TODO: check context if we should NOT do this (history apps?)
